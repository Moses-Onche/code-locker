# code-locker

Code Locker is a private community created to foster creativity in software development. We pick out challenging webpages to build weekly, share our builds and give each other feedback on how to improve. But as time goes on, we will take on more challenging projects. The goal is to learn to build faster and increasingly complicated things.
